## General

### [Steps to Become a Machine Learning Engineer](https://medium.com/cometheartbeat/7-steps-to-become-a-machine-learning-engineer-698cba0bc43c)

**what is machine learning**
- Sub field of Artificial inteligence that allows a machine to learn automatically and improve from experience
- techniquie for problem Solving and task automation

**Helpful libraries**
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- HuggingFace
- Comet

**3 key roles in data science projects**
- Data engineer
  -  Create systems/pipelines to
    - Collect raw data
    -  manage data
    -  transform data into information
- Data scientist
  - Create Model Prototype
- ML engineer
  - Use tools to create models
  - Deploy them top production

**Machine Learning Project Lifecycle**
- Data Preperation
  - Clean Data using data preprocessing
    - Prevent garbage in garbage out
- Model Building
  - build the best model with the data they are provided from step above
    - Start with Simple models (regression)
    - Then move to complex models (neural networks)
  - Evaluate performance of the models (accuracy, precuision, recall, F1)
- Model Deployment
  - Deploy, Monitor and maintain the best model from above
    - put into production
  - Ensure that the model is making correct predictions 
**7 steps to becom an ML engineer**
1. Programming 
  - 2 primary languages 
    - R
    - Python
      - General Purpose
      - End to end machine learning projects 
        - cleaning to model deployment 
      - has the following frameworks
        - Pytorch
        - Skicit-Learn
        - Pyspark 
    
2. Machine learning Algorithms
  - Important to know algorithms to know when and what algorithms to use
  - 4 categories of algoisthms are
    - Regression (superviesd learning)
      - Linear Regression
      - Decision Trees
      - Support Vector Machines 
    - Classification (superviesd learning)
      - Logistic Regression
      - Naive Bayes
      - K-Nearest Neighbors 
    - Clustering (Unsuperviesd learning)
      - K-means
      - DBSCAN
      - Gaussian Mixture Models 
    - Dimensionallity Reduction (Unsuperviesd learning)
      - PCA
      - LDA
      - t-SNE 
3. Applied Mathmatics
  - Includes lots of applied mathmatics
    -  Statitics
    -  Linear Algebra
    -  Calculus
    -  Probability Theory
    -  Discrete Maths
  -  Applied when training the model coefficients
  -  Most are based in statistics
4. Deep Learning
  - ML models work well with small to medium datasets
  - Struggle with large datasets 
    - Deep Learning is used to handle these sets
      - Subset of ML that is an extension of artificial neural networks
      - examples of large datasets are
        -  image classification
        -  language to language techinques
          - GPT-3
          - BERT
      - Deep Learning is Black Box (dont know how they work)
      - Deep learning algorithms to know    
        - multilayer perception
        - convolutional neural networks
        - recurrent neural networks
        - long short-temr memory networks
        - generative adversarial networks
        - Transformers
        - Diffusion 
5. Machine learning Frameworks
  - Pandas
    - Good for data preprocessing
  - Matplotlib
    - Data Visulization
  - Seaborn
    - Data Visulization
  - Scikit-learn
    - implement machine learning algorithms
  - Tensorflow
    - deep learning analysis
  - Pytorch 
    - deep learning analysis
  - Comet
    - Model Optimization
6. MLOps (machine learning operations)
  - Putting machine learning into production

  - DEVOps equivalent for machine learning
  - Useful tools are
    - MLFLow
    - KubeFlow
    - MetaFlow
    - DataRobot
7. Cloud Computing
  -  Cloud computing helps you to train models on powerful machines with multiple GPUs
  -  deploy those models
  -  run as many servers as you want
  -  cloud computing services for machine learning are
    -  Amazon SageMaker
    -  Microsoft Azure Machine Learning
    -  GCP Vertex AI for ML engineering
