## General

### [Steps to Become a Machine Learning Engineer](https://medium.com/cometheartbeat/7-steps-to-become-a-machine-learning-engineer-698cba0bc43c)

**what is machine learning**
- Sub field of Artificial inteligence that allows a machine to learn automatically and improve from experience
- techniquie for problem Solving and task automation

**Helpful libraries**
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- HuggingFace
- Comet

**3 key roles in data science projects**
- Data engineer
  -  Create systems/pipelines
    -  Collect raw data
    -  manage data
    -  transform data into information
- Data scientist
  - Create Model Prototype
- ML engineer
  - Use tools to create models
  - Deploy them top production

**Machine Learning Project Lifecycle**
- Data Preperation
  - Clean Data using data preprocessing
    - Prevent garbage in garbage out
- Model Building
  - build the best model with the data they are provided from step above
    - Start with Simple models (regression)
    - Then move to complex models (neural networks)
  - Evaluate performance of the models (accuracy, precuision, recall, F1)
- Model Deployment
  - Deploy, Monitor and maintain the best model from above
    - put into production
  - Ensure that the model is making correct predictions
